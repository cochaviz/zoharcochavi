### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zohar and I'm currently a computer science and engineering student at TU Delft! I'm mainly interested in theoretical computer science, but almost everything about computer science is interesting to me.

I'm currently also playing [battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/cochaviz/), so challenge me if you dare! :)
